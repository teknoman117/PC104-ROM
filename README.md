# PC104-ROM

A carrier board for a 32 pin JEDEC ROM device. Used to override the internal ROM of the Technologic Systems TS-3100.

The TS-3100 does not have a compliant PC/104 connector, as the DMA pins are replaced with some internal signals. This board takes advantage of that by allowing an external ROM to be selected from some of these signals.
